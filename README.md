#Minesweeper with an Ai agent 
This is an implementation of the classic game Minesweeper in Python, along with a reasoning-based AI that plays the game intelligently by inferring safe moves and identifying mines from known information.

This project was developed as part of the [CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/) course.
